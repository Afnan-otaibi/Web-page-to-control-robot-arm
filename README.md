# ** Web-page-to-control-robot-arm**

This repository displays a web page for controlling the movement of the robot arm.

# ** Description**
I developed a website, this website is to help to control the robot arm. First, In the index.php file, I wrote codes for sliders and makes their degrees between 1-180 so the motors move based on the sliders. In the conn.php file, I succeeded in making the connection between the website and the database.
In the sl.js file, I wrote javascript codes to assign the sliders to their values. In the style.css file, there are to make the website appearance more acceptable. I made two buttons one for turn on/off the robot arm and another to save/update the data in database by getting them from sliders data. I used XAMPP as servere. Finally, in robot-arm.sql are codes of the database, there is a table with 4 columns contain id,motor_name , degree of the slider, and the state :ON/Off.
